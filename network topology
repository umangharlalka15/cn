Set up the network topology as shown in fig 1. Simulate different type of internet traffic Such as traffic using FTP between the nodes n1 â€“ n6 and Telnet between the nodes n2-n5.   Plot congestion window for FTP and Telnet, and analyze the throughput.

Fig. 1: Network Topology
Solution :	

Aim: To understand and design TCP Applications like FTP and Telnet. Here we see that the throughput of both the application vary depending on the data size


Save the following program as ex2.tcl

set ns [new Simulator]

set tf [open ex2.tr w]
$ns trace-all $tf
set nf [open ex2.nam w]
$ns namtrace-all $nf
set cwind [open win2.tr w]

set n0 [$ns node]
set n1 [$ns node]
set n2 [$ns node]
set n3 [$ns node]

$ns duplex-link $n0 $n2 5Mb 2ms DropTail
$ns duplex-link $n1 $n2 5Mb 2ms DropTail
$ns duplex-link $n2 $n3 1.5Mb 10ms DropTail

set tcp0 [new Agent/TCP]
$ns attach-agent $n0 $tcp0
set sink0 [new Agent/TCPSink]
$ns attach-agent $n3 $sink0
$ns connect $tcp0 $sink0

set ftp [new Application/FTP]
$ftp attach-agent $tcp0

$ns at 1.2 "$ftp start"
set tcp1 [new Agent/TCP]
$ns attach-agent $n1 $tcp1
set sink1 [new Agent/TCPSink]
$ns attach-agent $n0 $sink1
$ns connect $tcp1 $sink1
set telnet [new Application/Telnet]
$telnet attach-agent $tcp1

$ns at 1.5 "$telnet start"
$ns at 10.0 "finish"
proc plotWindow {tcpSource file} {
global ns
set time 0.01
set now [$ns now]
set cwnd [$tcpSource set cwnd_]
puts $file "$now $cwnd"
$ns at [expr $now+$time] "plotWindow $tcpSource $file" }
$ns at 2.0 "plotWindow $tcp0 $cwind"
$ns at 5.5 "plotWindow $tcp1 $cwind"
proc finish {} {
	global ns tf nf cwind
	$ns flush-trace
	close $tf
	close $nf

	puts "running nam..."
	puts "FTP PACKETS.."
	puts "Telnet PACKETS.."
	exec nam ex2.nam &
        exec xgraph win2.tr & 
	exit 0
}
$ns run

Expected output: Animated 4 node structure is displayed. We need to see the trace file to understand what has happened to the data flow depending on the application used.

Awk script to calculate throughput
BEGIN {
     last = 0

	if (type == "tcp" && action == "r" && to == "3" ) 
           tcp_sz += pktsize
    
if (type == "cbr" && action == "r" && to == "3" ) 
            cbr_sz += pktsize

 }
END {
     print time, ( tcp_sz * 8 / 1000000)
    print time , (tcp_sz * 8 / 1000000 ), ( total_sz * 8 / 1000000)
 }
