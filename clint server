Consider a client and a server. The server is running a FTP application over TCP. The client sends a request to download a file of size 10 MB from the server. Write a TCL script to simulate this scenario. Let node n0 be the server and node n1 be the client. TCP packet size is 1500 Bytes.

Solution:	
Aim: To understand the working of a client and a server, when transmitting 10MB file from server to the client.  


Save the following program as ex6.tcl

#Create a ns simulator
set ns [new Simulator]

#Open the NS trace file
set tracefile [open ex5.tr w]
$ns trace-all $tracefile

#Open the NAM trace file
set namfile [open ex5.nam w]
$ns namtrace-all $namfile

#Create 2 nodes
set s [$ns node]
set c [$ns node]

$ns color 1 Blue

#Create labels for nodes
$s label "Server"
$c label "Client"

#Create links between nodes
$ns duplex-link $s $c 10Mb 22ms DropTail

#Give node position (for NAM)
$ns duplex-link-op $s $c orient right
	
#Setup a TCP connection for node s(server)
set tcp0 [new Agent/TCP]
$ns attach-agent $s $tcp0
$tcp0 set packetSize_ 1500

#Setup a TCPSink connection for node c(client)
set sink0 [new Agent/TCPSink]
$ns attach-agent $c $sink0
$ns connect $tcp0 $sink0
#Setup a FTP Application over TCP connection
set ftp0 [new Application/FTP]
$ftp0 attach-agent $tcp0
$tcp0 set fid_ 1
proc finish { } {
	global ns tracefile namfile 
	$ns flush-trace
	close $tracefile
    	close $namfile
    	exec nam ex5.nam &
	exec awk -f ex5transfer.awk ex5.tr &
	exec awk -f ex5convert.awk  ex5.tr > convert.tr &
	exec xgraph convert.tr -geometry 800*400 -t "bytes_received_at_client" -x "time_in_secs" -y "bytes_in_bps"  &
		}
$ns at 0.01 "$ftp0 start"
$ns at 15.0 "$ftp0 stop"
$ns at 15.1 "finish"
$ns run

Expected output: Animated 2 node structure is displayed with the node labeled as client and server. We need to make use of the awk script to calculate the time required to transfer the 10 MB file from the server to client and duration for converting downloaded file into MB.


Save the following awk script as ex5transfer.awk

# AWK script to calulate the time required to transfer the 10 MB file from the server to client
BEGIN {
	count=0;
	time=0;
        total_bytes_sent =0;
        total_bytes_received=0;
}
{
	if ( $1 == "r" &&  $4 == 1 && $5 == "tcp")
				total_bytes_received += $6;

        if($1 == "+" &&  $3 == 0 && $5 == "tcp")
				total_bytes_sent +=  $6;
} 
END {
       system("clear");
       printf("\n Transmission time required to transfer the file is %f",$2);
       printf("\n Actual data sent from the server is %f Mbps",(total_bytes_sent)/1000000);
       printf("\n Data Received by the client is %f Mbps\n",(total_bytes_received)/1000000);            	 
} 


Save the following awk script as ex5convert.awk

# AWK Script to convert the downloaded file into MB
BEGIN {
	count=0;
	time=0;
}
{
	if ( $1 == "r" &&  $4 == 1 && $5 == "tcp")
	{
		count += $6;
		time=$2;
		printf("\n%f\t%f",time,(count)/1000000);		
	}
}
END {
}
