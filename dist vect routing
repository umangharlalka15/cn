Design networks that demonstrate the working of Distance vector routing protocol. The link between node 1 and 4 breaks at 1.0ms and comes up at 3.0ms. Assume that the source node 0 transmits packets to node 4. Plot the congestion window when TCP sends packets via other nodes. Assume your own parameters for bandwidth and delay.

	Solution:	

Aim: To understand the working o distance vector routing. 


Save the following program as ex4.tcl

set ns [new Simulator]

set tf [open ex4.tr w]
$ns trace-all $tf

set nf [open ex4.nam w]
$ns namtrace-all $nf
set cwind [open win4.tr w]

$ns color 1 Blue 
$ns color 2 Red

$ns rtproto DV

set n0 [$ns node]
set n1 [$ns node]
set n2 [$ns node]
set n3 [$ns node]
set n4 [$ns node]
set n5 [$ns node]

$ns duplex-link $n0 $n1 0.3Mb 10ms DropTail
$ns duplex-link $n1 $n2 0.3Mb 10ms DropTail
$ns duplex-link $n2 $n3 0.3Mb 10ms DropTail
$ns duplex-link $n1 $n4 0.3Mb 10ms DropTail
$ns duplex-link $n3 $n5 0.5Mb 10ms DropTail
$ns duplex-link $n4 $n5 0.5Mb 10ms DropTail

$ns duplex-link-op $n0 $n1 orient right
$ns duplex-link-op $n1 $n2 orient right
$ns duplex-link-op $n2 $n3 orient up
$ns duplex-link-op $n1 $n4 orient up-left
$ns duplex-link-op $n3 $n5 orient up-left
$ns duplex-link-op $n4 $n5 orient right-up

set tcp [new Agent/TCP]
$ns attach-agent $n0 $tcp
set sink [new Agent/TCPSink]
$ns attach-agent $n5 $sink
$ns connect $tcp $sink
$tcp set fid_ 1

set ftp [new Application/FTP]
$ftp attach-agent $tcp

$ns rtmodel-at 1.0 down $n1 $n4
$ns rtmodel-at 3.0 up $n1 $n4

$ns at 0.1 "$ftp start"

$ns at 12.0 "finish"
proc plotWindow {tcpSource file} {
global ns
set time 0.01
set now [$ns now]
set cwnd [$tcpSource set cwnd_]
puts $file "$now $cwnd"
$ns at [expr $now+$time] "plotWindow $tcpSource $file" }
$ns at 1.0 "plotWindow $tcp $cwind"

proc finish {} {
	global ns tf nf cwind
	$ns flush-trace
	close $tf
	close $nf
	exec nam ex4.nam &
        exec xgraph win4.tr & 
	exit 0
}
$ns run
Expected output: Animated 6 node structure is displayed. We need to see the nam file as well as the trace file to understand what has happened to the data flow.
